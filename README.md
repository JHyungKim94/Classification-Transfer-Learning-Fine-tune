## Classification

### 1. Network: VGG16
: Firstly, this network "vgg16.ipynb" is trained by ImageNet Dataset ## Fine-tune the last fully connencted layer with "3 layer".
â†’ That means only bus, truck, and car class. "other_models.ipynb" is compared to "vgg16.ipynb" in view of accuracy.

### 2. Dataset: Crawling
: By crawling on Google, Naver, Dataset is set up.

### 3. Reference
a. "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition" (Karen Simonyan, Andrew Zisserman)
